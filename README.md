# Assignment_HTML_CSS - News Article/ Blog Webpage

This web page was a project I created from scratch.
  
It is a blog / news page for the New York Islanders.
  
The web page is a single view.
  
I had lots of fun learning about design and layout doing this project. It includes the following:
  -Nav Bar
    -Fixed Social Media Icon
    -Picturs with link
      -Table views
        -Hyperlinks
