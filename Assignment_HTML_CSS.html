					Jaroslav Halak returns to the Islanders’ crease Thursday against the Capitals. Halak hasn’t played since Dec. 21 missing five games with an upper-body injury. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>“He looks pretty good</strong>,” Jack Capuano said. “<em>We wouldn’t put anybody in that wasn’t ready. He skated in Pittsburgh, came back and skated with [Goaltending Coach Mike Dunham] for a couple days and felt really good yesterday. He went through the on ice and off-ice workouts. He’s 100 percent.</em>”
				</p>
				<p>
					Halak is the only change to the Islanders’ lineup, as Capuano is sticking with the same forwards and d corps. That means 
					<a href="http://islanders.nhl.com/club/player.htm?id=8476917#&navid=NYI-keymatch" target="_blank">
						<span style="color:RoyalBlue">Adam Pelech</span>
					</a> 
					stays in the lineup for a second straight game.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>“We knew defensively he was solid,”</em> Capuano said of Pelech. “<em>He’s got a good stick and a good gap. I like the way he’s playing, he’s moving the puck, he’s jumping in the holes offensively when the opportunity presents itself. He played really well last game so it was hard for me to take him out. He’s going to get another opportunity tonight against a good hockey team.</em>”
				</p>
				<p>
					There are some hard feelings between the New York Islanders and Washington Capitals.
				</p>
				<p>
					They played a grueling seven-game series in last year’s playoffs, a war of attrition between two heavy teams grinding each other down. There were casualties,namely 
					<a href="http://islanders.nhl.com/club/player.htm?id=8468598" target="_blank">
					<span style="color:RoyalBlue">Lubomir Visnovsky</span>
					</a>
					, who was knocked out of the series on a hit by Washington’s Tom Wilson. There was passion, written all over the Islanders’ faces after both thrilling wins and devastating losses. Intensity reverberated throughout the stands from Uniondale to D.C., all stemming from what was happening on the ice.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Capitals won 2-1 in the deciding game and afterwards, honoring playoff tradition, the two teams shook hands. But on the eve of their first meeting this season, there’s a sense that this hatchet is not buried.

					“When you have battles like that with teams, those feelings tend to come back pretty quickly in those games,” 
					<a href="http://islanders.nhl.com/club/player.htm?id=8473504">
						<span style="color:RoyalBlue">Cal Clutterbuck</span>
					</a> said.
				</p>
				<p>
					Clutterbuck said that walking that fine line between fired up and over the top comes with maturity, but there’s definitely a little extra fire when a top rival comes to town.
				</p>
				<p>
					“There’s a great rivalry with them now,” 
					<a href="http://islanders.nhl.com/club/player.htm?id=8476458" target="_blank">
						<span style="color:RoyalBlue">Ryan Strome</span>
					</a> said. “There’s no question that for whoever watched that playoff series, there’s bad blood. The teams matched up pretty well; it came down to one goal in Game 7. Certainly it was a fun series. I expect no different and I expect the atmosphere to be pretty good in the rink tomorrow.”

				</h2>
				<p>
					The playoffs were chapter one in this rising rivalry and chapter two will be written with largely the same characters. The Islanders are icing the same forward corps and the Capitals are relatively intact from last year, save for the addition of T.J. Oshie. With the Islanders’ 
					<a href="http://islanders.nhl.com/club/player.htm?id=8475166" target="_blank">
						<span style="color:RoyalBlue">John Tavares</span>
					</a> and the Capitals’ Alex Ovechkin, each team is led by one of the NHL’s elite stars. They’re joined by young talent such as New York’s 
					<a href="http://islanders.nhl.com/club/player.htm?id=8475754>"
						<span style="color:RoyalBlue">Brock Nelson</span>
					</a>
					and Washington’s Evgeny Kuznetsov. These games could be heated for years to come.
				</p>
				<p>
					“Obviously we’re two teams that don’t really like each other,” 
					<a href="http://islanders.nhl.com/club/player.htm?id=8474709">
						<span style="color:RoyalBlue">Matt Martin</span>
					</a>
					, who will surely be throwing the body Thursday, said. “It makes for a good game and hopefully we come out on top.”
				</p>
				<p>
					The Metropolitan Division standings add to the intrigue. Washington sits atop the Metro (and the NHL) with 61 points, while the Islanders are number two in the division with 49. The Islanders say this game is a measuring stick, but don’t believe the point gap is representative of how they stack up against Washington.

					“Obviously they are the best team in the league right now. It’s a good matchup for us, a good test for us,” Martin said. “They have a big physical team and we have a big physical team.”

				<p>
					The Islanders switched up their gameday routine Thursday, taking an optional morning skate at Islanders Iceworks in Syosset. The switch is designed to give the players more time at home during the day. The Islanders are planning to adopt the new routine for Thursday and Tuesday’s home games (there’s no morning skate Sunday due to the 4 p.m. start) and will take it on a game-by-game basis going forward.

						<span style="font-family:Impact;font-size:20px">NOTE WORTHY:</span>
				</h3>
				<p>
					The Islanders stressed discipline against the Capitals’ potent power play, which is number two in the league. Travis Hamonic said prevention is the best method to killing penalties. Or as he put’s it…
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>“The best way to avoid a shark-bite is to stay out of the water.”</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					Jaroslav Halak (upper body) was activated off the team's injured reserve list on Tuesday afternoon. Halak was placed on IR on Dec. 27, retroactive to Dec. 21, as he sustained his injury in the Islanders' 5-2 win over the Anaheim Ducks. Halak is 10-6-3 this season with a 2.09 goals against average and a .923 save percentage. 
				</p>
				<p>
					To make room for Halak's activation, Christopher Gibson was returned on loan to the Bridgeport Sound Tigers on Tuesday afternoon. Gibson was recalled on Dec. 27 after Halak was placed on injured reserve and made his NHL debut on Jan. 2 against the Pittsburgh Penguins, stopping 16-of-17 shots in relief of Thomas Greiss.

				<p>
					Johnny Boychuk will miss the next 4-to-6 weeks with an <em>upper-body injury</em>, according to a team-issued report. He will not require surgery.   
				</p>
				<p>
					Boychuk suffered the injury on Dec. 31 against the Buffalo Sabres, when he crashed into the end boards. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Johnny Boychuk (upper body) was placed on the Islanders’ injured reserve list on Friday morning. Boychuk crashed into the end boards in the third period of Thursday’s game against the Buffalo Sabres and did not return. A timetable will be established next week when Boychuk sees team doctors. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Adam Pelech was recalled from the Bridgeport Sound Tigers on Friday morning. Pelech has two goals and four assists in 26 games for Bridgeport this season. Pelech played two games for the Islanders earlier this eason, making his NHL debut against the Anaheim Ducks on Nov. 13.
